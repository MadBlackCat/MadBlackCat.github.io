tags： 论文

They investigate how permissions and privacy could play a more active role in app-selection decisions. They designed a short “Privacy Facts” display, which they tested in a 20-participant lab study and a 366-participant online experiment. They found that by bringing privacy information to the user when they were making the decision and by presenting it in a clearer fashion, they could assist users in choosing applications that request fewer permissions. 
Through this paper, we can also find that most users do not pay attention to privacy when choosing an app download.

However , one of the main problems with this paper is that the paper was published in 2013 . In 2015 , Android 6.0 was released , and there are many new features of application rights management . The main thing is that after Android 6.0 , some of the more dangerous privacy permissions will prompt the user for authorization at the first time . (similar to IOS)
