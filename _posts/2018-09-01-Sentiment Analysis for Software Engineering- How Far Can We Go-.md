## Method

They applied SentiStrength, SentiStrength-SE, NLTK, Stanford CoreNLP, Stanford CoreNLP SO to analyze Stack Overflow, app reviews and JIRA data.

## Result

No tool is ready for real usage of identifying sentiment expressed in SE related discussions yet. 

Specific re-training is required, but does not represent a silver bullet for improving the accuracy.

Some software engineering applications make sentiment analysis easier than others.


## About App Reviews

most tools can predict positive texts with reasonable precision/recall values. Even for negative reviews, the results are in general much better. But in the app reviews dataset the accuracy in identifying neutral items is very low.

## Contribution

Their results should warn the research community about the strong limitations of current sentiment analysis tools.
