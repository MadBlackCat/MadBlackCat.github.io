They proposed a novel method to detect low rating Android apps only based on the .apk fles. With their approach, an app market does not need to risk its reputation by exposing low rating apps to end users for rating collection.

In their approach, they frst proposed novel representations for the executable fle as well as the UI layout of an Android app. Then, based on the executable and UI representations, they built a convolutional neural network model to detect low rating Android apps.
