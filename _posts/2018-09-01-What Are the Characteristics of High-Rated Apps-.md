## 解决了什么问题，有什么意义

For the apps' developers knowing the "DNA" (i.e., characteristics) of high-rated apps is the first step towards successful development
and evolution of their apps.

## 实验结果
The size of an app, the number of promotional images on its store page, and the target SDK are the three most influential factors in determining the likelihood of an app being a high-rated app.


## 不足

They focus on factors that developers can control and strive to
improve or change.他们从google play上面抓取了1492个应用并通过分析应用的size，complexity of code, dependence on libraries, quality of library Code等factor来观察是否rating和factor之间的关系and what are the important factors that could indicate that an app will be an high-rated.

They used random-forest classifier to identify whether an app will be high-rated or not. Correlation and redundancy analyses are applied to better model the integrated impact of the factors on app rating.

But they don't care about reviews factors and the details of permissions. They only care about the total numbers of permissions.

They find that the size of an app, the number of promotional images on its store page, and the target SDK are the three most influential factors in determining the likelihood of an app being a high-rated app.
